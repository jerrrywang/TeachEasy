# TeachEasy

My team and I created TeachEasy during the 2018 Horizons Hackathon.

TeachEasy is a React application that displays sentiment analysis of students in a lecture video.

Technologies used: <b>React.js, Chart.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB</b>
APIs used: <b>Kairos</b> (for sentiment analysis)
Styling done with Material UI

Finished in <b>3rd place</b>.

Why?
Professors struggle to analyze their lecture performances, often unable to identify concepts that weren't communicated or taught well. 

With TeachEasy, professors can upload a video of their students during a lecture. TeachEasy will generate sentiment analysis of each student over the course of the video and graph changes in sentiment over time. That way, professors can identify the exact moments students are confused or frustrated during their lectures.
